					The title of this presentation is "The Interface of

				<h1>What is open source?</h1>
				<aside class="notes">
					Before we dive into the main content of the presentation.
					Let us have a quick review of "What is open source".
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h1>Access</h1>
				<aside class="notes">
					And the first keyword defines open source is who can access
					the code. If the author put the source code of the project
					on the internet for everyone to read, it is usually
					considered open source. The usages are often protected by
					their open-source licenses. For example, some of the
					licenses may prevent you from using their code to make
					money.
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h1>Umidigi F2 kernel source code</h1>
				<aside class="notes">
					However, there are always corner cases. The Umidigi F2 is a
					fork of the Linux kernel. And the Linux kernel is protected
					by the GPLv2 open-source license that requires all the code
					using it to be open-source. So, they have to open source
					their code according to the license. One day a user send an
					email to request their code since they could not find it on
					the Internet. Guess what reply the got?
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h1>"You can request the shareable source code at our office." </h1>
				<h2>Ben, UMIDIGI</h2>
				<aside class="notes">
					This is the reply they got. "You can request the shareable
					source code at our office." So they may need to apply their
					visa and book a air ticket and hotel to get the source code.

					And with all these intentionally created difficulties, the
					code is still considered open source. Pretty interesting.
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h1>What is the website for open source?</h1>
				<aside class="notes">
					To open source the code, we usually just put it onto the
					internet. What is the website for open source? Which
					website is the most popular one?
				</aside>

				</div>
				<aside class="notes">
					A really popular website a long time ago was the SourceForge.
					Let's have a quick show hands of who has heard about this
					website before. This was the number one open-source website
					recommended by a professor during my undergrad. It is
					mainly a website for users to publish the source code of
					their software. But we all know the story afterwards.

					Collaboration. GitHub has a far better user experience for
					collaboration between the open-source developers. On GitHub,
					you can easily collaborate with other developers who share
					the same interest. Everyone can contribute to every project.

					The third one, which I believe is the most important one, is
					about having full control over its machine learning

					be some other framework out there gaining popularity in the

					Google lose full control over its infra.

					It is really important but often overlooked.

					The installation guide for GPU on the official TensorFlow

					is not compatible with TensorFlow 1. The APIs changed

					Now, with Keras3, we officially support 3 backends:
					TensorFlow, JAX and PyTorch.

					Now, with one set of code, you get the benefits from all
					frameworks. The eager developing and debugging experience of
					PyTorch. Tap into the comprehensive tooling of the
					TensorFlow ecosystem. Faster training with JAX on TPU.

					Because of these benefits, it got adopted by MidJourney
					right away. They want the deployment path with PyTorch and
					want faster training with JAX.

					Keras is a high-level API, and it is the best of its kind if
					considered independent of the underlying frameworks. And the
					high-level API is just about user experience. Here are the 3
					simple principles that we followed to ensure this user
					experience.
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h1>Principle 1: </h1>
				<h1>Design end-to-end workflows</h1>

						Args:
							input: A tensor. The input to the model.
						"""
						pass
				</code></pre>
				<aside class="notes">
					When we think of designing the APIs of a piece of software, you may look like this.
					Define the class and add the documentations.
					However, this would not help us understand much about the user experience.

				model = keras.models.Model(inputs=input, outputs=output)
				model.compile(
					optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy'
				)
				</code></pre>
				<aside class="notes">
					What we should do is something like this. We want to write
					out the entire user workflow of using the software. Idealy,
					it should be a tutorial of how to use the software. It
					provides much more information about the user experience.
				</aside>

					Let's look at another example. This is from KerasTuner.

					However, if we write an end-to-end workflow like this.

				<h1>Principle 2:</h1>
				<h1>Minimize cognitive load</h1>
				<aside class="notes">
					Principle number two, minimize the cognitive load for the
					user when learning to use your software. Do not force the
					user to learn anything unless it is really necessary.  Let's
					see some good examples.
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Good example: Keras modeling</h2>
				<pre data-id="code-animation"><code data-trim data-line-numbers class="language-python">
				model = keras.Sequential([
					layers.Dense(10, activation="relu"),
					layers.Dense(num_classes, activation="softmax"),
				])
				model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy')
				model.fit(...)
				model.predict(...)
				</code></pre>
				<aside class="notes">
					One good example is the Keras modeling API, which is pretty intuitive.
					The model builders already have these concepts in mind, like a model is a stack of layers.
					It needs a loss function. We can fit it with data or make it predict on data.
					So basically, no new concepts learned in order to use Keras.
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Good example: PyTorch modeling</h2>
				<pre data-id="code-animation"><code data-trim data-line-numbers class="language-python">
					class MyModel(nn.Module):
						def forward(self, x):
							if x.sum() > 0:
								return self.path_a(x)
							return self.path_b(x)
				</code></pre>
				<aside class="notes">
					Another good example is the PyTorch modeling.
					The code is executed just like Python code.
					All tensors are just real tensors with real values.
					You can depend on the value of a tensor to decide your path
					with plain Python code.
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Bad example: Keras with JAX or TensorFlow</h2>
				<pre data-id="code-animation"><code data-trim data-line-numbers class="language-python">
					class MyModel(keras.Model):
						def call(self, x):
							return ops.cond(
								ops.sum(inputs) > 0,
								lambda : self.path_a(inputs),
								lambda : self.path_b(inputs),
							)
				</code></pre>
				<aside class="notes">
					You can also do this with Keras with TensorFlow or JAX
					backend, but needs to be written in a different way.
					All the if conditions need to be written with this ops.cond function.
					This is less intuitive which is bad. In compensation, it brings
					significant improvement in training speed.
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Bad example: PyTorch memory and speed optimization</h2>
				<pre data-id="code-animation"><code data-trim data-line-numbers class="language-python">

				x = torch._foreach_add(x, y)
				torch._foreach_add_(x, y)

				<aside class="notes">
				</aside>
			</section>

				<h2>Bad example: PyTorch compute gradients</h2>
				<pre data-id="code-animation"><code data-trim data-line-numbers="1-6|5" class="language-python">
				inputs, labels = batch
				outputs = model(inputs)
				loss = torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy(outputs, labels)
				optimizer.zero_grad()
				loss.backward()
				optimizer.step()
				</code></pre>
				<aside class="notes">
					loss.backward computes the gradients.
					This is introducing a new concept of actually computing the gradients. 
					I don't think the user has to know about it.
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Good example: keras.ops, tensorflow.numpy, jax.numpy</h2>
				<aside class="notes">
					When you have to introduce some cognitive load,
					just reuse what people already familiar with.
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h1>Worst case: trick the users</h1>
				<aside class="notes">
					The worst thing you can do with user experience is to trick the users.
					Trick the user to believe your API is something else than what it really is.
